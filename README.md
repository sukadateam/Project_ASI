ASI = Artificial Sh#tty Intelligence

## DISCLAIMER
This project requires ***A LOT*** of RAM for saving the image, and a very fast network to ping all those addresses!
And this uses a lot of bandwidth. Beware!

## About
Pings every possible IPv4 address from 1.0.0.0 upwards and draws a pixel depending on that IP's return status.
